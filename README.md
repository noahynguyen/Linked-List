# Linked-List
University of Washington Bothell  
CSS 342: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics 
Program 3:  Linked Lists 
 
 
Purpose 
 
This programming assignment will require the usage of dynamic memory, pointers and linked 
lists.  It will also require the usage of File IO and templates.   Also, required is a good 
understanding of overloading assignment and copy constructors.   Learnings from previous 
assignments, especially operator overloading will also be required. 
 
Problem: The List. 
 
You will build a class for a fully ordered list.  The list class, called List342, will be templatized so 
that different types of objects can be stored in it. 
 
 List342<string> some_strings; 
 List342<int> list_of_integers; 
 List342<Child> children; 
 List342<MyRandomObj> ordered_list_random_objs; 
 
The following member functions should be created for the List342 class.  Please make sure the 
signatures are exact or points will be deducted as the test programs will not compile.   
 
There is code in this document which you should test your program with to make sure it 
works.  These test cases are not exhaustive but if these test cases do not build the grader will 
not be able to test your code. 
 
Please make sure that the proper constructors/destructors are created for the class. 
 
 bool   BuildList(string file_name) : Given a string which represents a file, open the file, 
read the objects from file, and build an ordered list.  Note that BuildList puts the responsibility 
on the Object class to know how to read from a file.  That is, do not have object specific logic in 
the implementation.  You can insert each item into the list as you read it from the file.  If a list 
already has an item do not add it to the list; only add the new items to the list. 
 
 Assume that the text in the file is well-formed for the object being read into. 
  
bool   Insert( T* obj ) :  Insert an object in the list in the correct place.  Return true or 
false depending on whether the insert was successful.   Duplicates of an object are not allowed 
and should return false.  Note that a pointer to the object is passed in but the Insert should 
create a copy of the object to keep in the list. 
 
bool   Remove(T target, T& result):  Remove the target item from the list.  Return the 
item using a second parameter that is passed in by reference.  If the item was found and 
removed return true, else return false.   
bool   Peek(T target, T& result) const:   The same as Remove except the item is not 
removed from the list.  Again, the second item is returned by reference. 
 
bool   isEmpty() const:  Is the list empty? 
 
 void   DeleteList():  Remove all items from the list.  Deallocate all memory appropriately.  
This includes not only the nodes in the list but the items being pointed to by the nodes.  
 
 bool   Merge(List342& list1):  Takes a sorted list and merges into the calling sorted list 
(no new memory should be allocated). At termination of function, the list passed in (list1) 
should be empty (unless it is the calling list).  No duplicates are allowed. 
 
The following operators should be overloaded for the List342<>.  Please make sure signatures 
are correct on overloads. 
 
 +, += :  This should add two lists together.  The lists are assumed to be sorted and the 
returned list must also be sorted.  Use an efficient sort algorithm and avoid unnecessary data 
allocations.  Duplicates are not allowed and expected.  
 
 << :  Display the list and only the List object, no extra blanks, no tabs, no endl.  Display 
the items on the list in increasing order.  See examples below. 
 
 == and != :  check for equality or inequality. 
 
 =  :  Assignment.  Make a deep copy of all new memory.   
 
Details on testing: 
 
We will utilize multiple different types to test the list.  For instance, we will create a list of ints 
and a list of strings.  As List342<> is templatized we will also test with a set of objects we create.  
For instance, I will test your list with a Bird class—I will make sure I have the appropriate 
operators overloaded in that class so that it will work with your list. 
 
In order for you to test your List342<> I have some code below which utilizes a Child class.   
 
The child class contains a first name (string), last name (string), and age (int).   Stream input, >>,  
is of the  form “firstname lastname age” in the file.  Assume the test in the file is well formed 
w/o errors.   
 
Here is an example file: 
 George Washington  12 
 Lyndon Johnson 12 
 Joseph Smith  4 
 Thomas Paine   17 
 Thomas Paine   17 
 
 The Child class compares names alphabetically by last name first; first name second; and 
then age.  A child is considered a duplicate if all three fields (firstName, lastName, age ) are 
equivalent.   
 
 I provide code below which utilizes the Child class and the List342<>. 
 
 
Other Rules  
 
1) Implement the List342<> class using Nodes defined as below.  It can be internal or 
external to the List342<> class whatever you find easiest. 
 
Note that the struct contains a pointer to the next Node and a pointer to the data. This 
is required for this program.  
 struct Node { 
T *data;  
Node *next; 
}; 
 
2) Due to vicissitudes of different IDEs and templating we will be factoring the code into 
files a little sub-optimally.  Put all code into the List342.h file—this includes the 
implementation (.cpp) as well as the .h.    
 
TURN IN ( .zip file): 
o list342.h (Note: the implementation is at the bottom of the file) 
o Output of your program running the example code below
